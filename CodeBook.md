##  Codebook of Human Activity Recognition Summary Using Smartphones Dataset 

==================================================================
# Data:
==================================================================
This dataset contains summary information of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory) 

For the oringinal dataset, The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

In this dataset, we merge the training and test sets. There are 180 observations and 81 variables in this dataset 


Variables
==================================================================
- id		An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.  Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- activity	Activity name. 	(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
