# READ.ME

The repositoray  includes the following files:
=========================================
- 'README.txt': It explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
- 'CodeBook': It explains the dataset and variables. 
- 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Summary Dataset' : 
    The summary dataset contains the training and test datasets of the original 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset'
- 'run_analysis.R' : This script does the following. 
    STEP 1: Import the original data
    STEP 2: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    STEP 3: xtracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    STEP 4: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    STEP 5: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    STEP 6:From the dataset in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set named "final" with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
